In my actual code, I decided to decide the computer's pick in the function, but I will assume the computer's choice is passed into the function here. I will also assume the result is printed outside of the function, unlike my python code

Create a function called determineWinner, which takes in two parameters: the computer's choice and the player's choice.

When tie is returned, it means the game is a tie.
If computer is returned, it means the computer won.
If player is returned, it means the player won.

If the computer's choice is equal to the player's choice, return "tie"
If the player's choice is equal to "rock",
    If the computer's choice is "paper", return "tie"
    else, return "computer"
If the player's choice is equal to "paper",
    If the computer's choice is "scissors", return "computer"
    else, return "player"
If the player's choice is equal to "scissors",
    If the computer's choice is "rock", return "computer"
    else, return "player"
