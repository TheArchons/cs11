2.	Write pseudocode for a program that…
a.	Asks the user how many students they have.
b.	Allows the user to enter a student’s name, and 3 of their grades as percentages.
c.	It calculates the average grade for each student.
d.	Outputs the student’s name and average grade for the student with the highest mark in the class.

first, ask for the user to input the number of students
define a list called students. This will store lists of each student and their grades
then, ask for the user to input the name of the student and 3 of their grades as percentages, separated with a comma.
Split the input into a list, convert the last 3 values into integers, and add the list to the list students

define a variable called highestGrade and set it to 0
define a variable called highestStudent and set it to ""

loop through the list students, setting each value in the list to a variable called student
    save the sum of the 3 grades divided by 3 to a variable called averageGrade
    if averageGrade is greater than highestGrade, set highestGrade to averageGrade and set highestStudent to student
    print the name of the student plus ": ", and their average grade

if the highestStudent variable is not empty, print the name of the student with the highest grade, "has the highest grade of", and the highestGrade
else, print "No student has a higher grade than 0%"
