Take 1 line of input, and split it with commas, and set it to ins, while also printing "enter two fractions ".

If the second and fourth values of ins are equal, 
    print the sum of the first and third values. 
    Then, print "--", 
    and finally print the second value

If the previous line is False, (else)
    print the sum of the first value multiplied by the fourth value, and the third value multiplied by the second value.
    Then, print "--",
    Finally, print the second value multiplied by the fourth value

Method 2:

Alternatively, we can use the Fraction, from the fractions module, to do this.
First, import the Fraction module from fractions (from fractions import Fraction)

Take 1 line of input, and split it with commas, and set it to ins, while also printing "enter two fractions ".

If the second and fourth values of ins are equal, 
    print the sum of the first and third values. 
    Then, print "--", 
    and finally print the second value
    This is to prevent automated simplification of the fractions if the denominators are the same

If the previous line is false, (else)
    convert all values in ins into integers, 
    and then convert those values into Fractions.
    Assign the converted values to the variables fraction1 and fraction2.
    Then, assign the sum of fraction1 and fraction2 to the variable sum.
    Then, print the numerator of the sum variable (sum.numerator)
    Then, print "--",
    Finally, print the denominator of the sum variable (sum.denominator)
